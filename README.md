First HTML Web Site!

I'm studying a HTML Web Developer Training from DIO.me and this is the first project: Create a Website using the tags that i've seen in this training.
Was not that dificult, for real, HTML is not dificult, but as any subject, you have to pratice!

I'm glad that i could finish this project and i'm excited to try new and harder challenges.
